# How to Disable Public Sign-ups in Firebase

## ✅ Good News!

Firebase Authentication with Email/Password **does NOT allow public sign-ups by default**. 

Users can only be created by:
1. **Administrators in Firebase Console** (recommended)
2. **Server-side code with Admin SDK** (for automation)

## 🔒 What's Already Secured

### Client-Side
- ❌ No sign-up form in the application
- ❌ No registration page
- ✅ Only login page exists
- ✅ Login requires existing account

### Server-Side  
- ✅ Firebase Authentication only allows existing users to sign in
- ✅ New users can only be created via Firebase Console or Admin SDK
- ✅ Firestore rules enforce admin-only access

## 📋 Verification Checklist

To confirm sign-ups are disabled:

### 1. Check Your Application
- [ ] No `/register` or `/signup` routes exist
- [ ] Login form only has email/password fields
- [ ] No "Create account" or "Sign up" buttons

### 2. Check Firebase Console
- [ ] Go to: Authentication → Sign-in method
- [ ] Email/Password should be "Enabled"
- [ ] There should be NO sign-up page URL configured
- [ ] Under "Authorized domains", only your domains are listed

### 3. Test It
```bash
# Try to create account programmatically
# This should FAIL without admin credentials
curl -X POST https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v1/accounts:signUp?key=YOUR_API_KEY \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'
```

**Expected Result**: Error - "OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED" or similar

## 👥 How to Create User Accounts (Admin Only)

### Method 1: Firebase Console (Easiest)

1. **Go to Firebase Console**
   ```
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/scago-feedback/authentication/users
   ```

2. **Click "Add user"**

3. **Enter Details**
   ```
   Email: user@example.com
   Password: [secure password]
   ```

4. **Click "Add user"**

5. **Optional: Add to Admin List**
   - If they need admin access
   - Go to your Admin Panel → User Management
   - Add their email

### Method 2: Firebase Admin SDK (For Automation)

```javascript
const admin = require('firebase-admin');

async function createUser(email, password) {
  try {
    const userRecord = await admin.auth().createUser({
      email: email,
      password: password,
      emailVerified: false,
    });
    console.log('Successfully created user:', userRecord.uid);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating user:', error);
  }
}
```

## 🚫 What Users CANNOT Do

Users cannot:
- ❌ Create their own accounts
- ❌ Self-register through any form
- ❌ Use the Firebase Authentication sign-up API
- ❌ Access admin features without being in admin list

## ✅ What Users CAN Do

Users can:
- ✅ Login with credentials you created for them
- ✅ Reset their password (if you enable it)
- ✅ Access survey forms (public)
- ✅ Submit feedback (public)

## 🔐 Additional Security (Optional)

### 1. Disable Password Reset (If Desired)

If you want FULL control over accounts:

**Firebase Console → Authentication → Templates**
- Disable "Password reset" email template
- Users won't be able to reset passwords themselves
- Only admins can reset via Console

### 2. Enable Email Verification

**Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method → Email/Password**
- Toggle ON "Email link (passwordless sign-in)"
- Users must verify email before accessing

### 3. Set Password Policy

**Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Password policy**
- Minimum length
- Require uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Prevent common passwords

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check for Unauthorized Accounts

1. **Regularly review user list**
   ```
   Firebase Console → Authentication → Users
   ```

2. **Check for unexpected users**
   - Look for unfamiliar emails
   - Check creation dates
   - Verify all users are legitimate

3. **Use Admin Panel**
   ```
   Your App → /admin → Activity Log
   ```

## 🆘 If Someone Creates an Unauthorized Account

If you somehow find an unauthorized account:

### 1. Delete the Account
```
Firebase Console → Authentication → Users
→ Click user → Delete user
```

### 2. Check Security Rules
```
Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules
```

Make sure rules look like this:
```javascript
function isAdmin() {
  return isAuthenticated() && 
         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/config/admins).data.emails.hasAny([request.auth.token.email]);
}

match /feedback/{feedbackId} {
  allow create: if true;  // Public can submit
  allow read, update, delete: if isAdmin();  // Only admins can view
}
```

### 3. Review API Keys
```
Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service accounts
```

- Make sure no service account keys are exposed
- Rotate keys if compromised

## ✅ Summary

Your current setup:
- ✅ **Sign-ups disabled** - Users cannot self-register
- ✅ **Admin creation only** - You create all accounts
- ✅ **Login page only** - No registration form
- ✅ **Admin panel** - Manage users easily
- ✅ **Secure by default** - Firebase enforces this

**You don't need to do anything extra to disable sign-ups - it's already disabled!**

The only way to create accounts is:
1. You create them in Firebase Console
2. You add them via Admin SDK (server-side only)
