# Consent Dashboard Adaptation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive changes made to adapt the dashboard for digital consent forms vs hospital feedback surveys.

## Key Differences Between Survey Types

### Hospital Feedback Survey
- Has ratings (1-10 scale)
- Has hospital interaction descriptions
- Contains pain scores, wait times, length of stay
- Department satisfaction metrics
- NPS scoring

### Digital Consent Form
- No ratings
- Personal information (name, email, address)
- SCD connection types (checkbox: patient, caregiver, family member, healthcare provider, other)
- Contact preferences (may contact, mailing list, support groups, advocacy consent)
- Hospital care location
- Digital signature and date

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Survey Type Detection** - `isConsentSurvey()` function checks for consent-specific fields
2. **Metrics Calculation** - Dual path: hospital feedback metrics vs consent metrics
3. **Chart Data** - Added consent-specific chart data (SCD connections, contact preferences, geography)
4. **Filtered Search** - Adapted to search consent fields (name, email, city) instead of hospital interaction

### üîÑ In Progress
5. **Quick Insight Cards** - Need to show different cards for consent surveys
6. **Filter Controls** - Hide rating filter for consent surveys

### ‚è≥ Pending
7. **Dashboard Title/Description** - Adapt based on survey type
8. **Chart Selection Dropdown** - Show consent charts when viewing consent data
9. **Chart Rendering** - Display consent-specific charts
10. **Submissions Table** - Show appropriate columns (name/email instead of rating/experience)
11. **Submission Detail Modal** - Format consent fields properly
12. **AI Analysis** - Adapt prompts for consent data
13. **PDF Generation** - Format consent submissions appropriately

## UI Components to Update

### Header Section
```typescript
// Current:
<h1>Feedback Dashboard</h1>

## Code Pattern

Throughout the dashboard client, use this pattern:

```typescript
if (isConsent) {
  // Consent-specific rendering
} else {
  // Hospital feedback rendering
}
```

## Metrics Access Pattern

```typescript
// Hospital feedback
const avgRating = (metrics as any).avg
const excellent = (metrics as any).excellent

// Consent
const mayContactPercent = (metrics as any).consentMetrics?.mayContactPercent
const scdConnections = (metrics as any).consentMetrics?.scdConnectionCounts
```
