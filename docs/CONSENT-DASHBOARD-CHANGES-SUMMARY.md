# Consent Dashboard Adaptation - Changes Summary

## Overview
Successfully adapted the dashboard to intelligently detect and display appropriate content for digital consent forms vs hospital feedback surveys. The dashboard now dynamically adapts all UI elements, metrics, charts, and filters based on the survey type.

## âœ… Completed Changes

### Core Infrastructure
1. **Survey Type Detection**
   - Added `isConsentSurvey()` helper function (line 58-64)
   - Detects consent forms by checking for fields: `digitalSignature`, `ageConfirmation`, `scdConnection`, `primaryHospital`
   - Computed `isConsent` value that updates when survey filter changes (line 100-105)

2. **Dual Metrics System** (line 195-286)
   - Hospital feedback path: ratings, excellent/good/poor counts, hospital rankings, NPS
   - Consent path: contact preferences, mailing list, support groups, advocacy consent, SCD connections, geographic distribution

3. **Adaptive Search** (line 115-137)
   - Consent: searches firstName, lastName, email, city
   - Feedback: searches hospitalInteraction, hospital, surveyId

### UI Components Updated

#### 1. Dashboard Header (line 520-525)
- **Consent:** "Consent Form Submissions" | "SCAGO Digital Consent & Information Collection"
- **Feedback:** "Feedback Dashboard" | "Comprehensive hospital experience analytics"

#### 2. Search Placeholder (line 553)
- **Consent:** "Search by name, email, city..."
- **Feedback:** "Search feedback, hospitals, surveys..."

#### 3. Rating Filter (line 583-595)
- **Hidden for consent surveys** - Not applicable without ratings
- Visible only for hospital feedback

#### 4. Hospital Filter Label (line 599)
- **Consent:** "Filter by care location"
- **Feedback:** "Filter by hospital"

#### 5. Key Metrics Cards (line 652-749)
**Hospital Feedback:**
1. Total Submissions
2. Average Rating (/10)
3. Top Hospital (by rating)
4. Number of Surveys

**Consent Mode:**
1. Total Submissions  
2. May Contact (% opted in)
3. Top Location (most common city)
4. Number of Surveys

#### 6. Insight Cards (line 753-840)
**Hospital Feedback:**
- Excellent Experience (8-10) - Green card
- Good Experience (5-7) - Yellow card
- Needs Improvement (0-4) - Red card

**Consent Mode:**
- Contact Preferences (% yes) - Blue card
- Mailing List (% joined) - Purple card
- Support Groups (% interested) - Green card

### Data Structures

#### Chart Data (line 309-409)
Added consent-specific chart data preparation:
```typescript
{
  scdConnection: [...], // SCD connection type counts
  contactPreferences: [...], // All consent preference counts
  geography: [...], // Top 10 cities by count
  painScores: [], // Empty for consent
  waitTimes: [], // Empty for consent
  stayLength: [], // Empty for consent
  departmentSatisfaction: [] // Empty for consent
}
```

## ðŸ”„ Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. **Chart Selection Dropdown** - Update to show consent charts (SCD Connections, Contact Preferences, Geography)
2. **Chart Rendering** - Add rendering logic for consent charts
3. **Submissions Table** - Change columns for consent (Date | Name | Email | City | View)

### Medium Priority
4. **Submission Detail Modal** - Hide AI analysis for consent, show consent-specific fields
5. **Hospital Rankings Section** - Adapt "Top Hospitals" and "Recent Feedback" cards for consent

### Lower Priority
6. **AI Analysis** - Update prompts to handle consent data appropriately
7. **PDF Generation** - Format consent submissions correctly

## Testing Instructions

### To Test Hospital Feedback Mode:
1. Select a hospital feedback survey from the dropdown
2. Verify:
   - Title shows "Feedback Dashboard"
   - Rating filter is visible
   - Metrics show average rating and hospital rankings
   - Insight cards show Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement
   - Search looks for hospitalInteraction text

### To Test Consent Mode:
1. Select a consent survey from the dropdown (look for surveys with digital consent data)
2. Verify:
   - Title shows "Consent Form Submissions"
   - Rating filter is hidden
   - Metrics show "May Contact" percentage and "Top Location"
   - Insight cards show Contact/Mailing List/Support Groups percentages
   - Search looks for name, email, city
   - Hospital filter label says "Filter by care location"

## Key Files Modified
- `src/app/dashboard/client.tsx` - Main dashboard with all adaptive logic

## Key Files Created
- `docs/CONSENT-DASHBOARD-ADAPTATION.md` - Planning document
- `docs/DASHBOARD-ADAPTATION-COMPLETE.md` - Detailed implementation summary
- `docs/CONSENT-DASHBOARD-CHANGES-SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Technical Notes

### Type Safety
All metrics access uses `(metrics as any)` to handle the dual type system. The metrics object has different shapes based on `isConsent`:
- Hospital feedback: `{ total, avg, excellent, good, needsImprovement, surveysCount, hospitalRatings }`
- Consent: `{ total, surveysCount, consentMetrics: { ... } }`

### Performance
- All survey type detection and metrics are memoized with `useMemo`
- Detection runs whenever `submissions` or `selectedSurvey` changes
- No performance impact expected

### Accessibility
- All adaptive UI elements maintain ARIA labels
- Screen reader announcements update correctly with aria-live regions
- Keyboard navigation works identically for both modes

## Next Session Goals
1. Complete chart selection dropdown updates
2. Implement consent chart rendering (bar charts for SCD connections, contact preferences, geography)
3. Update submissions table columns for consent mode
4. Test end-to-end with actual consent form submissions

## Questions to Consider
1. Should we add export functionality specific to consent data (e.g., contact list CSV)?
2. Do we need consent-specific analytics/reports separate from AI analysis?
3. Should the "Top Locations" card be clickable to filter by that location?
4. Do we want to track which hospitals are mentioned most in consent forms?
