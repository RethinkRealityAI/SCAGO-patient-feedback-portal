# AI Analysis Context Improvements

## Overview
Improved the AI analysis and chat system to provide survey-type-specific context, questions, and analysis. The system now automatically adapts to whether you're analyzing hospital feedback surveys, digital consent forms, or viewing an overview across all surveys.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dynamic Predefined Questions in Chat Interface
**File**: `src/components/ai-chat-interface.tsx`

#### Before
- Hardcoded predefined questions for hospital feedback only
- Questions like "High Pain Scores", "Wait Time Issues", "Subpar Hospitals"
- Not appropriate for consent forms or overview mode

#### After
- Survey-type-specific predefined questions via `getPredefinedQueries(surveyType)`
- **Feedback Survey Questions**: Pain scores, hospital ratings, wait times, patient satisfaction, staff interactions
- **Consent Survey Questions**: Geographic distribution, SCD connections, contact consent rates, engagement rates, hospital affiliations, underserved areas
- **Overview Mode Questions**: Survey breakdown, overall trends, geographic overview, cross-program insights, resource allocation, peak times

### 2. Survey Type Detection and Context Passing
**Files**: `src/app/dashboard/client.tsx`, `src/components/floating-chat-button.tsx`

- Dashboard now detects survey type based on filtered data (consent vs feedback vs overview)
- Survey type is passed through component chain: `Dashboard` → `FloatingChatButton` → `AIChatInterface`
- Chat interface automatically loads appropriate questions and context

```typescript
surveyType={(isAllSurveysMode ? 'overview' : (isConsent ? 'consent' : 'feedback'))}
```

### 3. AI Analysis Already Has Context
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/actions.ts`

The analysis functions already had proper context implementation:
- `analyzeFeedbackForSurvey()` uses `getSurveyContextFromId()` to detect survey type
- Builds survey-specific data summaries (consent vs feedback vs overview)
- Uses `getAnalysisPrompt()` to provide context-aware prompts to AI

### 4. Chat Data Function Has Context
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/actions.ts` - `chatWithFeedbackData()`

- Already uses survey context from `getSurveyContextFromId()`
- Contextualizes user queries with survey-specific information
- Includes key fields and analysis prompts in the AI context

## Survey Context System
**File**: `src/lib/survey-contexts.ts`

Provides three predefined contexts:

### Feedback Survey Context
- **Fields**: rating, hospital, department, pain scores, wait times, triage category
- **Focus**: Patient satisfaction, wait times, pain management, quality of care
- **Questions**: Pain points, department satisfaction, wait time reduction, safety concerns

### Consent Survey Context  
- **Fields**: personal info, SCD connection, contact preferences, hospital affiliations
- **Focus**: Demographics, SCD connections, engagement rates, geographic reach
- **Questions**: Geographic distribution, connection types, consent rates, underserved areas

### Overview Context
- **Fields**: survey breakdown, geographic distribution, submission trends
- **Focus**: Cross-survey insights, resource allocation, engagement patterns
- **Questions**: Survey popularity, overall trends, geographic patterns, strategic recommendations

## Benefits

### ✅ Contextual Relevance
- Questions and analysis adapt to the type of data being viewed
- No more irrelevant "pain score" questions when viewing consent forms
- No more "contact consent" questions when viewing hospital feedback

### ✅ Better AI Responses
- AI receives appropriate context about what fields exist in the survey
- Analysis focuses on relevant metrics for each survey type
- Recommendations are actionable and survey-specific

### ✅ Improved User Experience
- Users see questions that make sense for their current view
- Faster access to relevant insights
- Clear distinction between different survey types

### ✅ Automatic Detection
- System automatically detects survey type from submission data
- No manual configuration needed
- Seamless switching between survey types

## Examples

### Hospital Feedback Survey
**Quick Questions**:
- "How many patients reported high pain scores (7+ out of 10)?"
- "Which hospitals are performing best?"
- "What are the most common complaints?"

**AI Context**: "You are analyzing hospital patient feedback submissions. Focus on patient satisfaction, wait times, pain management, and quality of care..."

### Digital Consent Form
**Quick Questions**:
- "What is the geographic distribution of participants?"
- "What types of SCD connections are most common?"
- "What percentage opted in for contact?"

**AI Context**: "You are analyzing digital consent form submissions for SCAGO. Focus on demographic patterns, SCD connections, communication preferences..."

### All Surveys Overview
**Quick Questions**:
- "Show me a breakdown of submissions by survey type"
- "What are the overall submission trends?"
- "Which locations show highest engagement?"

**AI Context**: "You are analyzing data across multiple survey types. Focus on submission trends, geographic distribution, cross-survey insights..."

## Testing

To verify the improvements:

1. **Test Feedback Survey**:
   - Select a hospital feedback survey in dashboard
   - Open AI chat
   - Verify questions are about pain scores, ratings, wait times
   - Ask a question and verify AI understands it's hospital data

2. **Test Consent Survey**:
   - Select a digital consent form survey
   - Open AI chat  
   - Verify questions are about demographics, SCD connections, consent rates
   - Ask a question and verify AI focuses on participant data

3. **Test Overview Mode**:
   - Select "All Surveys" in dashboard
   - Open AI chat
   - Verify questions are about cross-survey patterns and trends
   - Ask a question and verify AI provides high-level insights

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/ai-chat-interface.tsx` - Added dynamic predefined queries
2. `src/components/floating-chat-button.tsx` - Pass through survey type
3. `src/app/dashboard/client.tsx` - Detect and pass survey type to chat
4. `src/lib/survey-contexts.ts` - Already had comprehensive context system (verified)
5. `src/app/dashboard/actions.ts` - Already had context-aware analysis (verified)
