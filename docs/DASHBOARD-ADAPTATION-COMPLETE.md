# Dashboard Adaptation for Digital Consent Forms - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. **Survey Type Detection**
- Added `isConsentSurvey()` helper function that checks for consent-specific fields
- Implemented `isConsent` computed value that updates when survey filter changes
- Detection logic checks for: `digitalSignature`, `ageConfirmation`, `scdConnection`, `primaryHospital`

### 2. **Dual Metrics System**
- **Hospital Feedback Metrics:**
  - Average rating (1-10 scale)
  - Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement counts
  - Hospital rankings by average rating
  - NPS segmentation
  
- **Consent Metrics:**
  - Contact preferences (% who opted in)
  - Mailing list participation
  - Support group interest
  - Advocacy consent
  - SCD connection type breakdown (checkbox selections)
  - Geographic distribution by city

### 3. **Adaptive Filter Controls**
- Search placeholder changes based on survey type:
  - Consent: "Search by name, email, city..."
  - Feedback: "Search feedback, hospitals, surveys..."
- Rating filter hidden for consent surveys
- Hospital filter label adapts: "Filter by care location" vs "Filter by hospital"

### 4. **Adaptive Header**
- Title changes:
  - Consent: "Consent Form Submissions"
  - Feedback: "Feedback Dashboard"
- Description changes:
  - Consent: "SCAGO Digital Consent & Information Collection"
  - Feedback: "Comprehensive hospital experience analytics"

### 5. **Key Metrics Cards (4 cards)**
#### Hospital Feedback Mode:
1. Total Submissions
2. Average Rating (/10)
3. Top Hospital (by rating)
4. Number of Surveys

#### Consent Mode:
1. Total Submissions
2. May Contact (% opted in)
3. Top Location (most common city)
4. Number of Surveys

### 6. **Insight Cards (3 cards)**
#### Hospital Feedback Mode:
- Excellent Experience (8-10) - Green
- Good Experience (5-7) - Yellow
- Needs Improvement (0-4) - Red

#### Consent Mode:
- Contact Preferences (% yes) - Blue
- Mailing List (% joined) - Purple
- Support Groups (% interested) - Green

### 7. **Chart Data Preparation**
Added consent-specific chart data:
- `scdConnection`: Array of SCD connection types with counts
- `contactPreferences`: Bar chart data for all consent preferences
- `geography`: Top 10 cities by submission count

### 8. **Search Functionality**
- Consent searches: firstName, lastName, email, city
- Feedback searches: hospitalInteraction, hospital, surveyId

## 🔄 In Progress

### 9. **Chart Selection Dropdown**
Need to update the chart selector to show:
- Consent charts: Submissions Over Time, SCD Connections, Contact Preferences, Geographic Distribution
- Feedback charts: Rating Trends, Pain Scores, Wait Times, Length of Stay, Department Satisfaction

### 10. **Chart Rendering**
Need to add rendering logic for:
- SCD Connection bar chart
- Contact Preferences bar chart
- Geographic Distribution bar chart

---

## ⏳ Still Needed

### 11. **Submissions Table**
Current columns: Date | Rating | Experience | View

**Consent columns should be:** Date | Name | Email | City | View

### 12. **Submission Detail Modal**
- Hide AI analysis button for consent (not applicable)
- Show consent-specific fields properly:
  - Personal Information section
  - SCD Connection details
  - Contact preferences
  - Digital signature confirmation

### 13. **AI Analysis Adaptation**
- Update AI prompts to handle consent data
- Generate appropriate insights for consent forms (demographics, engagement, geographic reach)
- Skip sentiment analysis for consent

### 14. **PDF Generation**
- Format consent submissions appropriately
- Include relevant consent fields instead of ratings/experience

### 15. **Hospital Rankings Section**
The "Top Hospitals by Rating" and "Recent Feedback Trends" cards need consent equivalents:
- Top Hospitals → Top Care Locations
- Recent Feedback → Recent Submissions (show name, date, city instead of rating/experience)

## Key Code Patterns Used

### Detecting Survey Type
```typescript
const isConsent = useMemo(() => isConsentSurvey(
  selectedSurvey !== 'all' 
    ? submissions.filter(s => s.surveyId === selectedSurvey) 
    : submissions
), [submissions, selectedSurvey])
```

### Conditional Rendering
```typescript
{isConsent ? (
  // Consent-specific UI
) : (
  // Hospital feedback UI
)}
```

### Accessing Metrics
```typescript
// Hospital feedback
const avgRating = (metrics as any).avg
const excellent = (metrics as any).excellent

// Consent
const mayContactPercent = (metrics as any).consentMetrics?.mayContactPercent
const scdConnections = (metrics as any).consentMetrics?.scdConnectionCounts
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Load dashboard with hospital feedback survey selected
- [ ] Verify all feedback metrics display correctly
- [ ] Load dashboard with consent survey selected
- [ ] Verify all consent metrics display correctly
- [ ] Test search functionality for both types
- [ ] Test filters for both types
- [ ] Verify charts show appropriate data
- [ ] Test submission detail modal for both types
- [ ] Test PDF generation for both types
- [ ] Test AI analysis for hospital feedback (skip for consent)
