# üìß Firebase Email Template Configuration for YEP Invites

## Issue
YEP invite emails are being "sent" but not received. This is because Firebase email templates need to be customized in the Firebase Console.

## What's Happening
When you send a YEP invite via the admin panel:
1. ‚úÖ Firebase Auth user is created successfully
2. ‚úÖ Firestore record is created/updated successfully  
3. ‚úÖ `generatePasswordResetLink()` is called successfully
4. ‚ùå **Email is not delivered** because template isn't properly configured

---

## üîß Solution: Configure Email Templates in Firebase Console

### Step 1: Access Email Template Settings

**Direct Link**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/scago-feedback/authentication/emails

**Or navigate manually:**
1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: **scago-feedback**
3. Left sidebar: **Build** ‚Üí **Authentication**
4. Click the **Templates** tab at the top

---

### Step 2: Customize Password Reset Email Template

The YEP invite system uses the **Password Reset** email template (since we're using `generatePasswordResetLink()` as a magic link).

#### 2.1: Edit Password Reset Template

1. In the **Templates** tab, find **"Password reset"**
2. Click the **pencil icon** (edit) on the right side

#### 2.2: Configure Sender Information

**Template name**: `Password reset` (leave as is)

**Sender name**: 
```
SCAGO Youth Empowerment Program
```
_Or use:_
```
SCAGO YEP
```

**Sender email**: 
```
noreply@scago-feedback.firebaseapp.com
```
_This is the default Firebase sender. You can customize this later with a custom domain._

**Reply-to email** (optional):
```
support@yourdomain.com
```
_Add your actual support email if you want users to be able to reply._

#### 2.3: Customize Email Subject

**Subject line**:
```
Welcome to SCAGO Youth Empowerment Program - Complete Your Profile
```

_Or shorter:_
```
Complete Your SCAGO YEP Profile
```

#### 2.4: Customize Email Body

Replace the default email body with this custom template:

```html
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>You've been invited to join the <strong>SCAGO Youth Empowerment Program</strong>!</p>

<p>To complete your profile and access your portal, please click the link below to set your password:</p>

<p><a href="%LINK%" style="background-color: #0070f3; color: white; padding: 12px 24px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 6px; display: inline-block;">Complete Your Profile</a></p>

<p>Or copy and paste this link into your browser:</p>
<p><code>%LINK%</code></p>

<p><strong>This link will expire in 1 hour.</strong></p>

<p>If you didn't request this invitation, you can safely ignore this email.</p>

<hr>
<p style="font-size: 12px; color: #666;">
  This email was sent by SCAGO Youth Empowerment Program<br>
  For support, please contact your program administrator
</p>
```

**Important**: Keep the `%LINK%` placeholder - Firebase will replace this with the actual password reset link.

#### 2.5: Save Template

1. Review all changes
2. Click **"Save"** button (bottom right)
3. Confirm if prompted

---

### Step 3: Test Email Delivery

#### 3.1: Check Email Configuration Status

After saving, check these settings:

**In Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Templates:**
- [ ] Password reset template shows "Customized" status
- [ ] Sender name is set
- [ ] Subject line is customized

#### 3.2: Test Sending an Invite

1. Go to your app: http://localhost:9002/admin
2. Click **"YEP Invites"** tab
3. Send a test invite to **your own email address**
4. Fill in:
   - **Email**: your-email@example.com
   - **Role**: Participant
   - **Name**: Test User
   - **Send Email**: ‚úÖ checked
5. Click **"Send Invite"**

#### 3.3: Check Your Inbox

**Wait 1-2 minutes** and check:
- [ ] Email received in inbox
- [ ] Subject line is customized
- [ ] Email is from "SCAGO Youth Empowerment Program"
- [ ] Link works when clicked

**If email not received**, check:
- [ ] Spam/Junk folder
- [ ] Promotions tab (Gmail)
- [ ] Email address is correct

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Email Still Not Received

**Possible causes:**

1. **Email provider blocking Firebase emails**
   - Try a different email provider (Gmail usually works well)
   - Check spam/junk folders
   - Add `noreply@scago-feedback.firebaseapp.com` to contacts

2. **Template not saved properly**
   - Go back to Templates tab
   - Verify changes are showing
   - Try editing and saving again

3. **Firebase project email service not enabled**
   - Should be automatic, but verify in Firebase Console
   - Check project settings for any email-related warnings

### Issue 2: Email Goes to Spam

**Solutions:**
- Add SPF record for Firebase domain (requires custom domain setup)
- Use custom domain with proper email authentication (see below)
- Ask recipients to add sender to contacts/safe senders list

### Issue 3: Generic "noreply" Sender Name

**Solutions:**
- Make sure you clicked "Save" after editing sender name
- Clear browser cache and check again
- It can take a few minutes to propagate

## üé® Advanced: Custom Email Domain (Optional)

For production use, you may want to send emails from your own domain (e.g., `noreply@yourdomain.com`) instead of `noreply@scago-feedback.firebaseapp.com`.

### Benefits:
- ‚úÖ Professional appearance
- ‚úÖ Better deliverability
- ‚úÖ Reduced spam probability
- ‚úÖ Custom branding

### Requirements:
- Your own domain name
- Access to domain DNS settings
- Firebase Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan

### Setup Process:

#### Step 1: Upgrade to Firebase Blaze Plan

1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Settings (gear icon) ‚Üí Usage and billing
2. Click "Modify plan"
3. Select "Blaze (Pay as you go)"
4. Note: Email sending is still mostly free (generous free tier)

#### Step 2: Set Up Custom Email Domain

Firebase doesn't directly support custom SMTP, but you have two options:

**Option A: Use SendGrid with Firebase Functions** (Recommended)
- Set up SendGrid account (free tier available)
- Configure Firebase function to send emails via SendGrid
- Use custom domain with proper SPF/DKIM records

**Option B: Use Mailgun/Postmark**
- Similar to SendGrid
- Set up service and integrate with Firebase

**Option C: Keep Firebase Default**
- Simplest option
- Works well for most use cases
- Requires good email template to avoid spam

## üîç Debugging Email Issues

### Check Firebase Logs

If emails aren't sending, check Firebase logs for errors:

**In Firebase Console:**
1. Go to **Functions** (if using functions)
2. Check **Logs** tab for errors

**Or check browser console:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Send an invite
4. Look for any error messages

### Verify Email Configuration

Run this diagnostic in your browser console while on the admin page:

```javascript
// Check if environment variables are set
console.log('App URL:', process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL);

// This should show the Firebase config
console.log('Firebase config:', {
  projectId: 'scago-feedback',
  authDomain: 'scago-feedback.firebaseapp.com'
});
```

### Test Email Link Generation

The invite action should return success:

```typescript
const result = await sendYEPInvite({
  email: 'test@example.com',
  role: 'participant',
  name: 'Test User',
  sendEmail: true
});

console.log('Result:', result);
// Should show: { success: true, userId: '...', inviteCode: '...' }
```
