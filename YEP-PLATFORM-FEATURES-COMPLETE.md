## 3. ✅ Pre-Populated Profiles for Invited Users

### How It Works

#### Scenario 1: User Already in Database
1. Admin has participant/mentor in system with ALL data
2. Admin sends invite (email or generates invite code)
3. User logs in or registers
4. **Profile is FULLY POPULATED** with existing data
5. User sees **Edit button** to make changes
6. User does NOT need to fill in anything

#### Scenario 2: New User (No Data)
1. Admin creates invite for new user
2. User logs in or registers
3. Profile has minimal data (just name/email)
4. User can edit and add their information

### Key Behavior
- **Edit Mode by Default**: Profile starts in READ-ONLY view
- **Edit Button**: Clearly visible at top-right of profile
- **Existing Data Preserved**: All admin-entered data remains
- **User Can Update**: Phone, address, availability, notes, emergency contacts

### Admin-Managed vs User-Editable Fields

#### Participants Can Edit
- Phone number
- Emergency contact relationship
- Emergency contact number
- Mailing address
- Street address, city, province, postal code
- Availability
- Notes

#### Participants CANNOT Edit (Admin-only)
- Name
- Email
- Region
- Approved status
- Contract signed status
- Syllabus signed status
- ID provided status
- SCD affiliation proof
- All other admin fields

#### Mentors Can Edit

#### Mentors CANNOT Edit (Admin-only)

- **Edit Mode**: Click Edit to enable form fields
