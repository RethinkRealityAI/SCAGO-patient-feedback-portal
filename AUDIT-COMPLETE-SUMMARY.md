## ✅ FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Updated TypeScript Interfaces** ✅

**File**: `src/lib/youth-empowerment.ts`

**Added to YEPParticipant**:
```typescript
// User-uploaded document URLs
healthCardUrl?: string;
healthCardFileName?: string;
healthCardFileType?: string;
photoIdUrl?: string;
photoIdFileName?: string;
photoIdFileType?: string;
consentFormUrl?: string;
consentFormFileName?: string;
consentFormFileType?: string;
```

**Added to YEPMentor**:
```typescript
// User-uploaded document URLs
policeCheckUrl?: string;
policeCheckFileName?: string;
policeCheckFileType?: string;
resumeUrl?: string;
resumeFileName?: string;
resumeFileType?: string;
referencesUrl?: string;
referencesFileName?: string;
referencesFileType?: string;
// Document status flags
resumeProvided?: boolean;
referencesProvided?: boolean;
```

---

### 2. **Fixed Document Upload Logic** ✅

**File**: `src/app/youth-empowerment/file-actions.ts`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Upload now sets BOTH document URL fields AND boolean flags
- ✅ Admin dashboard flags automatically updated when users upload documents
- ✅ Proper mapping: health_card/photo_id → `idProvided: true`
- ✅ Proper mapping: consent_form → `contractSigned: true`
- ✅ Proper mapping: police_check → `vulnerableSectorCheck: true`

**Upload Logic**:
```typescript
if (data.documentType === 'health_card' || data.documentType === 'photo_id') {
  updateData.idProvided = true; // Admin can see this
}
updateData[`${data.documentType}Url`] = fileUrl; // User can access file
```

---

### 3. **Enhanced Document Display Logic** ✅

**File**: `src/components/profile/profile-documents-new.tsx`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Checks BOTH boolean flags (admin) AND URL fields (user uploads)
- ✅ Shows documents as complete if EITHER source exists
- ✅ Different UI for admin-verified vs user-uploaded documents
- ✅ Fixed document ID from `id_document` to `photo_id` (consistent naming)

**Status Logic**:
```typescript
// Check admin flags
if (profile.idProvided && !fileUrl) {
  adminProvided = true;
  adminProvidedSource = 'ID provided by admin';
}

// Show as uploaded if either exists
uploaded: !!fileUrl || adminProvided
```

**UI Behavior**:
- Admin verified + no user upload → Shows complete + "Upload Your Copy" button
- User uploaded → Shows complete + View/Delete buttons
- Nothing → Shows "Upload" button

---

### 4. **Updated Admin Dashboard** ✅

**File**: `src/components/youth-empowerment/participants-table.tsx`

**Changes**:
- ✅ File column now shows ALL user-uploaded documents
- ✅ Separate download buttons for each document type
- ✅ Legacy `fileUrl` still supported
- ✅ Clean, compact UI with small buttons

**Display Logic**:
```typescript
{participant.healthCardUrl && (
  <Button onClick={() => window.open(participant.healthCardUrl, '_blank')}>
    Health Card
  </Button>
)}
{participant.photoIdUrl && (
  <Button onClick={() => window.open(participant.photoIdUrl, '_blank')}>
    Photo ID
  </Button>
)}
{participant.consentFormUrl && (
  <Button onClick={() => window.open(participant.consentFormUrl, '_blank')}>
    Consent
  </Button>
)}
```

---

### 5. **Fixed Document Delete Logic** ✅

**File**: `src/app/youth-empowerment/file-actions.ts`

**Smart Boolean Flag Handling**:
- ✅ When deleting health_card, checks if photo_id exists before clearing `idProvided`
- ✅ When deleting photo_id, checks if health_card exists before clearing `idProvided`
- ✅ Prevents premature flag clearing when multiple ID documents exist

---

## 🧪 TEST SCENARIOS VERIFIED

### Scenario 1: User Uploads Document ✅
1. User uploads health card → `healthCardUrl` set ✅
2. Boolean flag set → `idProvided: true` ✅
3. Admin dashboard shows "ID ✓" badge ✅
4. Admin can download health card file ✅

### Scenario 2: Admin Sets Boolean Flag ✅
1. Admin manually sets `idProvided: true` ✅
2. User profile shows document as "completed (admin verified)" ✅
3. User can still upload their own document ✅
4. After user upload, both flag and URL exist ✅

### Scenario 3: User Deletes Document ✅
1. User has both health_card and photo_id ✅
2. User deletes health_card ✅
3. `healthCardUrl` cleared ✅
4. `idProvided` flag REMAINS true (photo_id still exists) ✅
5. Admin dashboard still shows "ID ✓" ✅

### Scenario 4: Multiple Document Sources ✅
1. Admin sets `contractSigned: true` ✅
2. User uploads consent form ✅
3. Profile shows complete with source indicator ✅
4. Admin sees both flag AND download button ✅
